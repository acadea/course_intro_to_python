# variable
# Variable name should start with an alphabet or _
cheesy = "Are you sure you’re not tired??? You’ve been running through my mind all day."
# 1cheesy = "Are you sure you’re not tired??? You’ve been running through my mind all day."
# $cheesy = "Are you sure you’re not tired??? You’ve been running through my mind all day."
_cheesy = "Are you sure you’re not tired??? You’ve been running through my mind all day."

# Variables are case sensitive
Cheesy = 'heyyyooo'

# we are not allowed to redeclare variables using reserved python keywords like 'is' and 'class'

# is = 'heyyyooo'
# class = 'heyyyooo'

# Redeclaring variable will overwrite previous value
Cheesy = 'eyyy'

# print(Cheesy)
# print(cheesy)
# print(cheesy)
# print(cheesy)

# Integer are number without decimals
integer_number = 12

# float are number with decimals
float_number = 1.234

## we can perfom math operations in python using math operators

# print(integer_number + 5)
# print(integer_number * 5)
# print(integer_number - 5)
# print(integer_number / 5)

## we can join string together using the + operator. Joining strings are also known as 'concatenating string'

# print(Cheesy + cheesy)

## we can convert number into string by using the str() function
# print(Cheesy + str(integer_number))

# similarly the float() and int() function

# print(float(integer_number))
# print(int(float_number))

## boolean are True and False values
boolean_true = True
boolean_false = False

## we can do comparisons with the 'comparison operators'
# print(1 == 1)
# print(1 < 2)
# print(1 <= 2)
# print(1 > 2)
# print(1 >= 2)

# converting value to boolean
print(bool("hey"))  # True
print(bool(0))  # False
print(bool(21)) # True
print(bool(None))  # False
